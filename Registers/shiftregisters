There are 2 ways the data can travel inside a shift register
1) Serial In: At every clock pulse a new bit gets loaded into the register, therefore 4 bit register will need 4 clock pulses to get loaded
2) Parallel In: All bits get loaded in the single clock pulse.

Same is for output that is:
1) Serial Out: Only 1 bit accessible at a time
2) Parallel out: All bits accessible at same clock pulse

From this we have 4 types of registers:
 - SISO = Serial in Serial out
 - SIPO = Serial in Parallel out = Example: Time delay generation
 - PISO = Parallel in Serial out = Example: Arithmetic operations
 - PIPO = Parallel in Parallel out (Similar to the simple 8 bit register)
